description: "Shinichi realizes that the poison shrunk him, and after making it home, asks Professor Agasa for help. Agasa warns that to stay safely hidden from the men in black, Shinichi can tell no one else, even Ran - who coincidentally shows up, intending to check on Shinichi. Agasa convinces her to look after Shinichi, who tells her his name is Conan Edogawa. On the way to her house, Ran confides to Conan that she really likes Shinichi, but Conan's reply is interrupted by Ran's father rushing outside on the trail of a case. He brags that he's been hired to find a CEO's daughter, who was kidnapped by a 'man in black'. Conan sneaks along in case it is a lead, followed by Ran, who explains Conan's situation to Kogoro. Kogoro can't kick them out of a moving taxi, so simply orders them to stay out of the way.",

Ran hears the rumor and wants to visit the museum; when Conan and Kogoro mock her for believing it might be true, she forces them to come along after her fearsome display of smashing Kogoro's deck with her fist. While admiring a painting, Ran meets Ochiai, the curator of the museum, who explains his love for the art and then berates a museum worker named Kubota for not handling a painting properly. Another worker, Iijima, takes over the job before they are interrupted by the museum's new owner, Manaka, arriving with an architect. The museum will be demolished soon to make a casino, despite the sale having hinged on the promise to keep the museum open. After Kubota accidentally drops a helmet, Manaka mentions his plans to sell all the museum pieces, which frustrates Kubota enough to throw it down after, but Conan notices that Ochiai doesn't lecture Kubota this time.",

description: "Kogoro and Megure are tasked with a critical case that involves the kidnapping of a girl named Naoko Takei, who is being held hostage in a van near a warehouse by the harbor. When the group plus Ran, Conan and Naoko's father, Katsuhiko Takei, approach the van, however, the kidnapper panics and drives the van into the sea itself, killing both Naoko and themself. It turns out Naoko was a classmate of Shinichi and Ran, and as Megure asks Ran about her, Conan thinks of how she was an awkward and quiet 'lonely rich kid'.",

description: "After realizing that Conan's parents have not contacted them (Kogoro and Ran Mouri) for a long stretch of time, Ran asks when his parents will be returning from overseas. Suddenly, a woman by the name of Fumiyo Edogawa enters the Mouri Detective Agency and admits to the group that she is Conan's mother and wishes to take Conan home. Soon after, Conan revels on the idea and absolute truth that this person is indeed not his mother, as Conan does not really exist, and begins to grow anxious. Worrying that she might harm his new found 'family', he goes along with Fumiyo, planning to get away and figure out the mess he's gotten himself into. En route, Fumiyo reveals in Conan's horror that she knows Conan's identity as Shinichi Kudo, together with his family's background. Conan escapes from her car and rushes to Professor Agasa' house, but is kidnapped again by Fumiyo before he has a chance to contact him.",
