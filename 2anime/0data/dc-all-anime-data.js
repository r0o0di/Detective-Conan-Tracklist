description: "Shinichi realizes that the poison shrunk him, and after making it home, asks Professor Agasa for help. Agasa warns that to stay safely hidden from the men in black, Shinichi can tell no one else, even Ran - who coincidentally shows up, intending to check on Shinichi. Agasa convinces her to look after Shinichi, who tells her his name is Conan Edogawa. On the way to her house, Ran confides to Conan that she really likes Shinichi, but Conan's reply is interrupted by Ran's father rushing outside on the trail of a case. He brags that he's been hired to find a CEO's daughter, who was kidnapped by a 'man in black'. Conan sneaks along in case it is a lead, followed by Ran, who explains Conan's situation to Kogoro. Kogoro can't kick them out of a moving taxi, so simply orders them to stay out of the way.",

description: "Two security guards at the Beika Art Museum see a medieval suit of armor moving on its own. Ran hears the rumor and wants to visit the museum; when Conan and Kogoro mock her for believing it might be true, she forces them to come along after her fearsome display of smashing Kogoro's deck with her fist. While admiring a painting, Ran meets Ochiai, the curator of the museum, who explains his love for the art and then berates a museum worker named Kubota for not handling a painting properly. Another worker, Iijima, takes over the job before they are interrupted by the museum's new owner, Manaka, arriving with an architect. The museum will be demolished soon to make a casino, despite the sale having hinged on the promise to keep the museum open. After Kubota accidentally drops a helmet, Manaka mentions his plans to sell all the museum pieces, which frustrates Kubota enough to throw it down after, but Conan notices that Ochiai doesn't lecture Kubota this time.",

Ran and Conan notice another passenger, Natsue Hatamoto, who just married her husband, Takeshi, on the island they just left. Natsue's grandfather, Gozo, the head of the Hatamoto family and businesses, rants at his son-in-law, Kitarou, for allowing non-family members onto the ship. Natsue's uncle, Joji Hatamoto, muses that Gozo's bad mood is likely from Joji cooking Western rather than traditional food. Gozo also belittles Kitarou's son, Ichirou, for being an artist and pursuing a hopeless dream. Gozo then orders Takeshi to come visit his room before dinner, and leaves.",

Suddenly, a woman by the name of Fumiyo Edogawa enters the Mouri Detective Agency and admits to the group that she is Conan's mother and wishes to take Conan home. Soon after, Conan revels on the idea and absolute truth that this person is indeed not his mother, as Conan does not really exist, and begins to grow anxious. Worrying that she might harm his new found 'family', he goes along with Fumiyo, planning to get away and figure out the mess he's gotten himself into. En route, Fumiyo reveals in Conan's horror that she knows Conan's identity as Shinichi Kudo, together with his family's background. Conan escapes from her car and rushes to Professor Agasa' house, but is kidnapped again by Fumiyo before he has a chance to contact him.",

description: "Conan and Ran hear about the death of someone 'in a mask' and go to look. Conan slips through the police barrier only to be stopped by Inspector Yokomizo, who was recently transferred from Saitama to Shizuoka. While Yokomizo explains this to Ran, Conan sneaks the mask off to reveal Ebara. Ran recognizes him and explain the tour to Yokomizo while Conan discovers Ebara only has one glove on, and his costume's tie tied backwards. Yokomizo assumes Ebara was the sponsor but wonders whether the death is suicide or accident and asks where Kogoro is. Hideko tells them he's still in the bar, but stays to look at the body. Conan realizes that behind her sunglasses, she is crying.",

description: "In their hotel room, Ran sits miserably on the bed with the knowledge that only a certain person could have blocked her kick the way Night Baron did. Unsure what to do with the knowledge, she wishes for Shinichi to tell her what to do. A knock on the door interrupts her; she opens the door as far as the anti-theft lock allows to find Conan, who declares his experiment successful because she didn't close the lock herself. He notices her face and asks if she was crying, but she passes it off as yawning and Conan runs off again. He ends up in the same elevator as the two policeman, and as he ponders the suspects he overhears that the officer who was guarding Ebara's body and overpowered was himself a strong practitioner of karate. Like Ran earlier, Conan suddenly wonders if the identity of Night Baron may, in fact, be karate champion Satoru Maeda. But Ran confirms that Maeda has a perfect alibi because he was giving autographs to his fans. So Conan dismisses him as a killer and still wonders who did it. Talking to one of the hotel maids, Conan learns that the wind that blows in this time of the year is a famous one named 'Himekaze' aka 'Princess Wind', and it blows in a very special direction. Thanks to that, he finally figures out who the killer is.",

With the police roaming around the house, though, Conan begins to wonder if that's really all there is to it. His answer comes when suddenly, Heiji Hattori joins the group alongside his father Heizo, an old friend of the chairman who was supposed to take up the case, but recomended Kogoro instead. Bad thing, Heiji calls out to Conan by his actual name of 'Shinichi Kudo' (not knowing that Conan hasn't told Ran and Kogoro about his identity), and they have to make up a quick lie to cover up.",

description: "Hideomi's corpse is pulled out of the water, and Yasue mourns him heavily. The forensic expert says Hideomi's been dead for at least two days, so Megure thinks that he might have killed Mitsuaki and drowned himself immediately afterwards. There's a flaw in that theory, however: Hideomi's death was caused by poisoning, NOT by drowning. Since there were many stones in his pockets, they wonder if Hideomi first took poison and then threw himself in the pond, the stones pulling his body to the bottom so he wouldn't found. Nobuko adds that, by the time Mitsuaki married Yasue, Hideomi never managed to see him as his brother-in-law, even when he didn't openly object to their marriage.",
